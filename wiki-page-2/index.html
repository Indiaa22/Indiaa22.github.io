            <b>Graphic design</b> is a profession,<sup>[2]</sup> academic 
            discipline<sup>[3]</sup><sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup> and applied art 
            whose activity consists in projecting visual communications 
            intended to transmit specific messages to social groups, 
            with specific objectives.<sup>[6]</sup> Graphic design 
            is an interdisciplinary branch of design<sup>[1]</sup> and 
            of the fine arts. Its practice involves creativity, innovation 
            and lateral thinking using manual or digital tools, where it is 
            usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually.

            The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is 
            that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the 
            interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. 
            Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and the 
            compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery 
            to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone 
            expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand, 
            a demand that ends up being established linguistically, either 
            orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a 
            linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.<sup>[7]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of 
            knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, 
            it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be 
            applied in the aviation world[8] or space exploration.
            <sup>[9]</sup><sup>[10]</sup> In this sense, in some countries 
            graphic design is related as only associated with the production 
            of sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual 
            communication is a small part of a huge range of types and 
            classes where it can be applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,<sup>[11]</sup> 
            graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the 
            boom of rise of printing in Europe in the 15th century and 
            the growth of consumer culture in the Industrial Revolution. 
            From there it emerged as a distinct profession in the West, 
            closely associated with advertising in the 19th century<sup>[12]
            </sup> and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th 
            century. Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange 
            today, the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, 
            particularly because of the development of new technologies and 
            the need to pay attention to human factors beyond the competence 
            of the engineers who develop them.<sup>[13]</sup>

            William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using the 
            term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,<sup>[14]</sup> although 
            it appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of 
            Organized Labor, a publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, 
            in an article about technical education for printers:<sup>[15]</sup> 
        </p>
       
       
        <p>
            An Enterprising Trades Union
            … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among 
            printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of 
            design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and 
            develop into specialists in graphic design and decorating. …
        </p>

            A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the California 
            School of Arts & Crafts advertised a course titled Graphic Design 
            and Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design and 
            Lettering. Both classes were taught by 
            Frederick Meyer.<sup>[16]</sup>

            In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent 
            explosion of visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, 
            the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine 
            art has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, 
            principles, practices, languages and sometimes the same benefactor 
            or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale 
            of goods and services. In graphic design, "the essence is to 
            give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling 
            to artifacts that document the human experience."<sup>[17]</sup>

            The definition of the graphic designer profession is relatively 
            recent concerning its preparation, activity, and objectives.
             Although there is no consensus on an exact date when graphic 
             design emerged, some date it back to the Interwar period. Others 
             understand that it began to be identified as such by the late 
             19th century.<sup>[11]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            It can be argued that graphic communications with specific 
            purposes have their origins in Paleolithic cave paintings and 
            the birth of written language in the third millennium BCE. 
            However, the differences in working methods, auxiliary sciences, 
            and required training are such that it is not possible to clearly 
            identify the current graphic designer with prehistoric man, 
            the 15th-century xylographer, or the lithographer of 1890.

            The diversity of opinions stems from some considering any graphic 
            manifestation as a product of graphic design, while others only 
            recognize those that arise as a result of the application of an 
            industrial production model—visual manifestations that have been 
            "projected" to address various needs: productive, symbolic, 
            ergonomic, contextual, among others.

            Nevertheless, the evolution of graphic design as a practice and 
            profession has been closely linked to technological innovations, 
            social needs, and the visual imagination of professionals.<sup>[18] 
            </sup>Graphic design has been practiced in various forms throughout 
            history; in fact, good examples of graphic design date back to 
            manuscripts from ancient China, Egypt, and Greece. As printing 
            and book production developed in the 15th century, advances in 
            graphic design continued over the subsequent centuries, with 
            composers or typographers often designing pages according to 
            established type.<sup>[11]</sup>

            Graphic design can have many applications, from road signs to 
            technical schematics and reference manuals. It is often used in 
            branding products and elements of company identity such as logos, 
            colors, packaging, labelling and text.

                From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of 
                opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful 
                compositions of visual information – known as information 
                design. With the advent of the web, information designers with 
                experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to 
                illustrate the background to news stories. Information design 
                can include Data and information visualization, which involves 
                using programs to interpret and form data into a visually 
                compelling presentation, and can be tied in with information 
                graphics.

            A graphic design project may involve the creative presentation of 
            existing text, ornament, and images.

            The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights 
            the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and 
            by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. 
            The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs 
            which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; 
            communication as an agent.[citation needed]

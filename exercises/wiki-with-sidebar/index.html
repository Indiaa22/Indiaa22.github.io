                    skin care can be used to cleanse or protect the body or 
                    skin. Cosmetics designed to enhance or alter one’s

                    to conceal blemishes, enhance one’s natural features

                <p id="other-p">
                    The word cosmetics is derived from the Greek κοσμητικὴ 
                    τέχνη (kosmetikē tekhnē), meaning “technique of dress and o
                    rnament”, from κοσμητικός (kosmētikos), “skilled in ordering 
                    or arranging”<sup>[3]</sup> and that from 
                    κόσμος (kosmos), meaning “order” 
                    and “ornament”.<sup>[4]</sup> Cosmetics are 
                    constituted from a mixture of chemical compounds derived 
                    from either natural sources, or synthetically 
                    created ones.<sup>[1]</sup>

                <p id="other-p">
                    Though the legal definition of cosmetics in most countries 
                    is broader, in some Western countries, cosmetics are 
                    commonly taken to mean only makeup products, such as 
                    lipstick, mascara, eye shadow, foundation, blush, 
                    highlighter, bronzer, and several other product types.
                    In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration 
                    (FDA), which regulates cosmetics,<sup>[5]</sup>
                    defines cosmetics as products “intended to be applied to 
                    the human body for cleansing, beautifying, promoting 
                    attractiveness, or altering the appearance without affecting 
                    the body’s structure or functions”. This broad definition 
                    includes any material intended for use as an ingredient of a 
                    cosmetic product, with the FDA specifically excluding 
                    pure soap from this category.<sup>[6]</sup>

                    Techniques for changing appearance include contouring, which

                    Cosmetics have been in use for thousands of years, with 
                    ancient Egyptians and Sumerians using them. In Europe, the 
                    use of cosmetics continued into the Middle Ages—where the 
                    face was whitened and the cheeks rouged—<sup>[8]</sup> 
                    though attitude towards cosmetics varied throughout time, 
                    with the use of 
                    cosmetics being openly frowned upon at many points in 
                    Western history.[9] Regardless of the changes in social 
                    attitudes towards cosmetics, ideals of appearance were 
                    occasionally achieved through the use of cosmetics by many.
                    According to one source, early major developments in c
                    osmetics include:<sup>[1]</sup>
                    Kohl used by ancient Egyptians
                    Castor oil also used in ancient Egypt as a protective balm
                    Skin creams made of beeswax, olive oil, and rose water, 
                    described by the Romans
                    Vaseline and lanolin in the nineteenth century.
                    Historically, the absence of regulation of the manufacture 
                    and use of cosmetics, as well as the absence of scientific 
                    knowledge regarding the effects of various compounds on the 
                    human body for much of this time period, led to a number of 
                    negative adverse effects upon those who used cosmetics, 
                    including deformities, blindness and in some cases death. 
                    Many cosmetic products available at this time were still 
                    either chemically dubious or derived from natural resources 
                    commonly found in the kitchen, such as food colouring, 
                    berries and beetroot. Examples of the prevalent usage of 
                    harmful cosmetics include the use of ceruse (white lead) 
                    throughout a number of different cultures, such as during 
                    the Renaissance in the West, and blindness caused by the 
                    mascara Lash Lure during the early 20th century. During the 
                    19th century, there was a high number of incidences
                    [spelling?] of lead poisoning due to the fashion for red 
                    and white lead makeup and powder, leading to swelling and 
                    inflammation of the eyes, weakened tooth enamel and 
                    blackening skin, with heavy use known to lead to death. 
                    Usage of white lead was not confined only to the West, 
                    with the white Japanese face makeup known as oshiroi also 
                    produced using white lead. In the second part of the 19th 
                    century, scientific advances in the production of makeup 
                    lead to the creation of makeup free of hazardous substances 
                    such as lead.

                    Throughout the later 19th century and early 20th century, 
                    changes in the prevailing attitudes towards cosmetics led
                    to the wider expansion of the cosmetics industry. In 1882, 
                    English actress and socialite Lillie Langtry became the 
                    poster-girl for Pears of London, making her the first 
                    celebrity to endorse a commercial product.<sup>[10]</sup>
                    She allowed her name to be used on face powders and skin 
                    products.[11] During the 1910s, the market in the US was 
                    developed by figures such as Elizabeth Arden, Helena 
                    Rubinstein, and Max Factor. These firms were joined by 
                    Revlon just before World War II and Estée Lauder just 
                    after. By the middle of the 20th century, cosmetics were 
                    in widespread use by women in nearly all industrial 
                    societies around the world, with the cosmetics industry 
                    becoming a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the beginning 
                    of the 21st century.<sup>[12] </sup>
                    The wider acceptance of the use 
                    of cosmetics led some to see makeup as a tool utilised in 
                    the oppression and subjection of women to unfair societal 
                    standards. In 1968 at the feminist Miss America protest, 
                    protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products 
                    into a “Freedom Trash Can”,<sup>[13]</sup> with 
                    cosmetics among the 
                    items the protestors called “instruments of female 
                    torture”<sup>[14]</sup> and accoutrements of what they 
                    perceived to be enforced femininity.
                    As of 2016, the world’s largest cosmetics company is 
                    L’Oréal, founded by Eugène Schueller in 1909 as the 
                    French Harmless Hair Colouring Company (now owned by L
                    iliane Bettencourt 26% and Nestlé 28%; the remaining 46% 
                    is traded publicly).
                    Although modern makeup has been traditionally used mainly 
                    by women, men also use makeup to enhance their own facial 
                    features or cover blemishes and dark circles. The negative 
                    stigma of men wearing makeup in countries such as the United 
                    States has weakened over the years, with numbers increasing 
                    in the 21st century.<sup>[15]</sup>
                    Cosmetics brands have increasingly 
                    targeted men in the sale of cosmetics, with some products 
                    targeted specifically at men.<sup>[16][17]</sup>
                    Lead has been used as a makeup product in the 18th century. 
                    Although it is said to be lethal to women who applied it 
                    daily to achieve a pale complexion representing nobility 
                    while a tanner skin represents the working class. Lead can 
                    be detrimental to people’s health and cause death if mixed 
                    with the combination of lead and vinegar it allows lead to 
                    be absorbed through the skin.<sup>[18]</sup>

                    Though there are a large number of differing cosmetics used 
                    for a variety of different purposes, all cosmetics are 
                    typically intended to be applied externally. These products 
                    can be applied to the face (on the skin, lips, eyebrows and 
                    eyes), to the body (on the skin, in particular the hands and 
                    nails), and to the hair. These products may be intended for 
                    use as skincare, personal care or to alter the appearance,
                    with the subset of cosmetics known as makeup primarily 
                    referring to products containing colour pigments intended 
                    for the purpose of altering the wearer’s appearance; some 
                    manufacturers will distinguish only between “decorative”

                    <b>A makeup brush</b> is used to apply makeup onto the face. 
                    There are two types of makeup brushes: synthetic and 
                    natural. <b>Synthetic brushes</b> are best for cream 
                    products while natural brushes are ideal for powder 
                    products.[30] Using the appropriate brush to apply a certain 
                    product allows the product to blend into the skin smoothly 
                    and evenly.<b>A foundation brush</b>is usually a dense brush

                    A variety of organic compounds and inorganic compounds 
                    comprise typical cosmetics. Typical organic compounds are 
                    modified natural oils and fats as well as a variety of 
                    petrochemically derived agents. Inorganic compounds are 
                    processed minerals such as iron oxides, talc, and zinc 
                    oxide. The oxides of zinc and iron are classified as 
                    pigments, i.e. colorants that have no solubility in 
                    solvents. Cosmetic companies have become more transparent 
                    in the ingredients of their products because consumers are 
                    interested in the formula of their products.<sup>[31]</sup>

                    Handmade and certified organic products are becoming more 
                    mainstream, due to 
                    consumer concerns that certain chemicals in 
                    some skincare products may be 
                    harmful if absorbed through the skin. The FDA, which 
                    regulates the US cosmetic 
                    industry, says “FDA has not defined 
                    the term “natural” and has not established 
                    a regulatory definition for this term in 
                    cosmetic labeling.”[32] It goes on to 
                    warn consumers, “choosing ingredients from 
                    sources you consider “organic” or 
                    “natural” is no guarantee that they are safe.”

                    The term “mineral makeup” applies to a category of face 
                    makeup, including foundation, eye shadow, blush, 
                    and bronzer, made with loose, dry mineral powders.
                    These powders are often mixed with oil-water emulsions. 
                    Lipsticks, liquid foundations, and other liquid cosmetics, 
                    as well as compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush 
                    in compacts, are often called mineral makeup if they have 
                    the same primary ingredients as dry mineral makeups. Liquid 
                    makeups must contain preservatives and compressed makeups 
                    must contain binders, which dry mineral makeups do not.
                    Mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic 
                    fragrances, preservatives, parabens, mineral oil, 
                    and chemical dyes. For this reason, 
                    dermatologists may consider mineral makeup to 
                    be gentler to the skin than makeup that contains 
                    those ingredients.[33] Some minerals are nacreous 
                    or pearlescent, giving the skin a shining or 
                    sparking appearance. One example is bismuth 
                    oxychloride.<sup>[1]</sup> There are various 
                    mineral-based makeup brands, including: Bare Minerals, 
                    Tarte, Bobbi Brown, and Stila.
